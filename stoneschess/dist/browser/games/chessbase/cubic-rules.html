<p>This Cubic Chess implementation does not enforce any rule !</p>

<p>It is to be used as a support to invent your own rules. If you come up with interesting rules and want to see them implemented into Jocly,
please open an issue about it on the <a href="https://github.com/mi-g/jocly/issues/new" target="_blank">Jocly repository</a>.</p>

<p>A consequence of the fact that no enforced rule is that playing against an artificial intelligence is pointless. You should only use
this Cubic Chess in human-vs-human mode.</p>
